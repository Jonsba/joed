# Joed

This is the development of a prototype of an innovative [WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) document editor, which aims at fulfilling the following vision:

* Productivity: User can stay focused on what matters while writing his documents.
* Intuitiveness: Things are where they are expected to be. Little need to search where they could be in the menu or to search for help on google.
* Reliability: Adding, removing, editing content on the document should not unexpectedly mess-up the document typesetting.
* Powerfulness: All kinds of documents can be created, with a structure that can vary from simple to complex.

For more information, including some mockups that give a better picture on how this editor should look like, see my blog [here](https://jonsba.github.io/).

There is not much interesting material in the master branch at the moment, until version 0.1 will be released. The development of the upcoming 0.1 version takes place in the devel branch [here](https://github.com/jonsba/joed/tree/devel).
