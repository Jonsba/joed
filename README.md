## Joed

This is the development of a prototype of an innovative [WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) document editor, which aims at fulfilling the following vision:

* Productivity: User can stay focused on what matters while writing his documents.
* Intuitiveness: Things are where they are expected to be. Little need to search where they could be in the menu or to search for help on google.
* Reliability: Adding, removing, editing content on the document should not unexpectedly mess-up the document typesetting.
* Powerfulness: All kinds of documents can be created, with a structure that can vary from simple to complex.

For more information, including some mockups that give a better picture on how this editor should look like, see [my blog](https://jonsba.github.io/).

### Version 0.1 released
